laws can take on myriad forms. As a gamemaster, you have some choices to make. How detailed do you want the laws and justice system of a particular land or city? Do you base any of it on real-world ideals, or do you take a more fantastic approach from fiction or your own imagination? Regardless, here are some ideas to keep in mind, meant to be tailored to your own campaign.", "Arrested for Trial", "First, to have a trial you need living criminals. or do you? Right off we see some unique features.  ", "Is the city watch trained in subduing opponents first, defending themselves only with weaponry, or do they attack in full and anyone who survives is simply lucky enough to go to trial? Or, using special magic to communicate with the dead, does the city also bring in corpses for questioning and involvement? If so, at what cost to the city and taxpayers?", "Held for Trial", "A number of different lodgings are available to criminals, depending on the laws and disposition of the city and its law enforcers. Criminals not awaiting trial (for minor laws or public disruption) might face a night or two sleeping it off in a local watch outpost and maybe a small fine. For trial criminals, the city dungeons or special tower jails are used. Here they are provided with basic food and water and may or may not suffer any sort of collateral effects.  ", "To speed trials, magical questioning and probing may be employed, or in more draconian cities, torture for confession may play a part here.The Trial Itself", "Not every game needs a courtroom scene, but some amazing roleplaying stories over the years have come about from some important trial to further the plot. Trials consist of opening statements by a solicitor, barrister, or lawyer for the defendant and the prosecution. A judge, magistrate, or bailiff oversees the trial, possibly with a jury of peers of selected common folk and possibly magical aid for detecting lies or other magic in use. Witnesses may be called in to verify either side's story. Depending on the skullduggery and shady side of the city, \"professional\" witnesses paid for their point of view by either side may come into play. Once significant proof is reached closing arguments are heard by all, again by both sides.", "sentencing and Punishment", "This is where the real diversity comes in (and the tables provided for you are used). Determining the punishment for a criminal may be specified (if you do this, that is your punishment) or determined ", "based on the severity of the crime, jury reaction, and possible magistrate payoff. Certain magistrates gain reputations for tweaking punishments to fit the crimes they specifically abhor, and the outlook of a city's rulers (evil or good) can determine if the punishments lean toward further torture, disfigurement/violent death, or to fines, forced servitude, or banishment.", "Magic", "In a world of magic and spellcasters, the entire judicial system must take into account the effects. Special materials might be used as lining in jails or prisons to prevent scrying or teleportation. Perhaps special manacles prohibit spellcasting hand motions, or deliberate magic-dead zones are used for trials. Does the court allow or hire those who can sense lies, illusions, or other deception through magic? Are members of the clergy allowed to testify or officiate? Answering these questions can lead to a new twist on the subject.101 CHAPTER THREE "]}, {"header": "Table 3-42: Trials", "items": ["Bench trial, magistrate dispensing the law", "Brought before king",

The convent, which forms an annex to the church, now houses an archaeological museum where holy relics captured in crusades into evil lands in ages past are displayed.Building is actually an ancient mansion left to the church, only recently secured by church funds. ", "Inside are sprawling rooms dedicated to different aspects of the deity. The walls have been left intact, so while there is no one common hall of worship, many smaller ceremonies are simultaneously going on.Building housing the church is shaped like a morningstar or mace, with a long entry hall showcasing ", "many of the shields or banners used by the faithful when going to battle. At the business end, the building branches out like a star, with the main worship hall in the center and clerics' quarters, high priest's retreat, holy relics, and care and health halls branching outward.Built into a gigantic tree in the center of the community which dwarfs all those around it. The ", "tree is an icon of the deity and is said to have grown with the blessing of the god. Both naturally hollowed-out rooms and man-made additions on sturdy branches hold the various offices and prayer chambers of the faithful, a majestic natural stair winding up to all.Church consists entire of connected towers, the main hall divided by a screen depicting saints ", "and scenes from the religion's history. Gray slate and white beams are used to help support the towers and their multiple levels. There are no chairs or pews; during ceremonies all worshippers are expected to stand. Small towers toward the edges of the property house the church's popular meditation pools.Church is built around the skeleton of an ancient dragon that perished trying to force the faithful ", "from the land in years past. The skeleton acts as the framework for the walls; the head an atrium, its ribcage the worship hall, and the tail and limbs leading to clerics' chambers and rooms of solitude. Thin, clear ultra-thick glass windows all face the sunset.Church of magic is built into the side of an ancient and now-dormant volcano, shaped through ", "spells to form the volcanic glass into walls and towering spires dedicated to the deity. It all has a very organic feel; the magic used created ultra-smooth glass walls and flowing hallways rounded and calming to those who walk them. There are icons of the faith about, but they are small, leaving the majority of the place very open and accessible.Church was destroyed in a magical storm and the current high cleric continues the services among ", "the ruins. Stone walls with dangerous rubble removed are all that remains around simple tents used to house the clerics of the deity. They believe themselves unworthy and make amends to the deity.

Inside are many curved balconies, with stair and ladder access leading to study rooms with books, meditation chambers with resting facilities, and  clerics' quarters.Entrance of the church is full of fine wall paintings and the interior is entirely gold-painted. Domed ", "towers encircle the main building at all points of the compass. The roof is ringed by gargoyles. The main atrium has an ivy-covered altar and marble floors flanked with nearly 20 alcoves, where eternal candles burn. The windows have been bricked up to form archer holes.127 CHAPTER THREE Hollowed-out stone cave by the shoreline with a path leading to it. Inside the walls are decorated ", "with the paraphernalia of the deity and its faithful.

Instead of building a complex world of magic, this chapter's real purpose is to help keep whatever magic system you are using flavorful and (most of all) mysterious and exciting to the players.  Alternative sources of power can fuel a player's spellweaving character or a GM's sorcerous villain. There are plenty of exotic descriptions of spell effects, sigils, and events to spark the imagination. A plethora of possible new magic items are presented for your campaign - books, rings, wands, staves, rods, scrolls, and the usual host of weapons and armor (including possible side effects, command words, and an entire system for working up its history). In this way the chapter can help you prepare a massive treasure horde or the details on a single particular magic item you're introducing to your story. Some entries are meant to springboard your imagination, like the source of a wizard's powerful fireball. Other entries help define the minutiae that expound on mundane magic (potions and scrolls, for instance). There's no right or wrong way to use these ideas, and providing a single guideline for doing so would be irresponsible.", "Lastly, we added the great planes of creation to the magical landscape of this tome.
